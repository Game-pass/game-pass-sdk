Installation
Install GamePassSDK using npm:

```

Getting Started
To use GamePassSDK, you'll need:

A Solana wallet (keypair)
Access to a Solana network (mainnet, testnet, or devnet)

Usage
Initializing the SDK
First, import and initialize the SDK:
javascript

```javascript
import { GamePassSDK } from "game-pass-sdk";
import { Keypair } from "@solana/web3.js";

// Assume you have a function to get your game's keypair
const gameKeyPair = await getGameKeyPair();

const sdk = new GamePassSDK(gameKeyPair);
```

Game Management
Initialize a new game:
javascript

```javascript
const gameName = "My Awesome Game";
const gameAvatar = "https://example.com/game-avatar.png";

const result = await sdk.initializeGame(gameName, gameAvatar);
console.log("Game initialized:", result.transactionSignature);
```


User Management
Create a user game account:
javascript

```javascript
import { PublicKey } from "@solana/web3.js";

const gameId = new PublicKey("your-game-id");
const userAvatar = "https://example.com/user-avatar.png";
const gamerPublicKey = new PublicKey("gamer-public-key");

const tx = await sdk.getSerializedInitializeUserGameAccountTransaction(gameId, userAvatar, gamerPublicKey);
// Send this transaction to be signed by the user and submitted to the network
```


Update user level or score:
javascript

```javascript
const newLevel = 5;
const userGameAcctPublicKey = new PublicKey("user-game-account");

await sdk.updateUserLevel(newLevel, userGameAcctPublicKey);
```


Badge System
Create a badge:
javascript


```javascript
const badgeName = "Master Coder";
const badgeDescription = "Awarded for writing 1000 lines of code";
const badgeImageUri = "https://example.com/badge-image.png";
const criteria = "Write 1000 lines of code";

await sdk.createBadge(gameId, badgeMintAddress, badgeName, badgeDescription, badgeImageUri, criteria);
```


Leaderboard
Update the leaderboard:
javascript

```javascript
const leaderboardAddress = new PublicKey("leaderboard-address");

await sdk.updateLeaderboard(gameId, leaderboardAddress, userGameAcctPublicKey);
```

Error Handling
GamePassSDK methods throw errors when operations fail. Always wrap SDK calls in try-catch blocks:
javascript

```javascript
try {
    await sdk.initializeGame(gameName, gameAvatar);
} catch (error) {
    console.error("Failed to initialize game:", error);
}
```
